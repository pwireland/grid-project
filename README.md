# EquipmentDbApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Requirements

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (built with Node.js v8.x and npm v5.x)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/) (built with angular cli v6.x)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center)* (built with Community edition v3.6)

## Run

Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
Then run `npm run build` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

\***[02/07/2018]**: Since the database is not currently set up, it is advised to run `ng serve` instead of `npm run build`. This will ignore the server side of the project and temporary removes the need to set up MongoDB.

*NB: Make sure the MongoDB server is running when launching the application. Refer to the [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/) if needed.*

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
